A hackathon project for Koding.com's hack.summit() Feburary 21, 2016 by SpaceLabForever.com

> IMPORTANT!!! YOU MUST click PROCEED ANYWAYS!! Yes, it is unsecured, Koding.com was not providing certificates and we didn't want to bend the rules. This is not malicious. **

##"Who needs additional equipment and apps? You have a web browser and a computer with a camera... That's all you need! Do more with the technology that you already have!  Just say where would you like your surveilance images sent!"

###Easy installation instructions:

1. Download / clone the code
2. Find the directory, wherever you placed it in your favorite command prompt.
3. type npm install
4. goto the localhost:8080
5. **touch mailer-config.JSON** and update the values below:

mailer-config.json
{
  "user": "someMailAddress@gmail.com",
  "pass": "u298djx2dj93m",
  "from": "Space Cam <someMailAddress@gmail.com>",
  "subject": "subject of message",
  "body": "body of message"
}


** On some servers you need a security certificate **

An HTML5 surveillance prototype utilizing the resources at our immediate disposal. Do more with what you already have! No need to get out there and buy more things. We have so much technology available and usaully all it takes is a little tinkering, drive, and ingenuity to make something awesome happen!

This is an idea that I kicked around for awhile in my head but never really sat down to create it. I'm a designer by trade and I like to consider myself a "prototyper." 

Conversersely I hope that this project will drive discussion on recent events that are taking place to encroach on our personal freedoms and cognitive liberties. Privacy is at the heart of what is at stake and hopefully this will help us evaluate our behaviors and our actions and what's really going on and what is at stake.

#### Hackathon Backstory 

When my usual suspects (team) were unavailable I interviewed Zhengyang Liu, an acquaintance who works with a friend of mine, who has a really rad Mustang... and... I so happen to rebuild classic Mustangs for sport and hobby and sometimes sale. Of course this would work!

While at the hotel bar it became apparent that a Women's Engineer Conference was taking place at Bell Harbor Marina across from where I live in Seattle, Washington USA. 

I spent the next couple hours looking for addditional teammates, however, despite the interest and lovely conversation, they were too busy to assist or were aerospace, civil, electrical, materials, mechanical. Very inspiring to see how many women are leading the charge into the future through engineering programs! 

They were all excited about this product and I returned to the hotel today to demo it before the  engineers left and they were thrilled with the pace that Zhengyang Liu and myself were able to put this together!  I told thm about the hackathon and some of the sponsors and the themes and they were inspired and driven to learn some more code and compete in the next one!  $100K is serious money!
